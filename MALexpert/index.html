In June 2003, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) arrived at the conclusion that no reform process will be credible and sustainable if government cannot demonstrate any leadership commitment with a public declaration about service delivery among other essentials. In this context, the former president set up a Nigerian Service Delivery Research Team which visited the United Kingdom (UK) in 2003 to investigate how the British government has gone about improving its service delivery.Based on their feedback, the FEC supported the implementation of Service Delivery programme for Nigeria.  The President and British Prime Minister tasked a team to analyze key service delivery issues and develop a road map for practical, targeted and achievable service delivery.
